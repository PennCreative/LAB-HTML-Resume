    <h3><a href="#">Interstate Packaging</a></h3>
    <h4>From: October 2019 To: July 2020</h4>
    <section>
      <p>This was a fun factory job where I got the pleasure of working on narrow web printing presses. I learned to set them up and break them down. I learned a lot about what goes into the stamping and screen printing processes. When mass layoffs happen due to a pandemic, I was unfortunately let go.</p>

    <h3><a href="#">Broadway Consulting</a></h3>
    <h4>From: July 2019 To: October 2019</h4>
    <section>
      <p>This was a pyramid scheme disguised as a marketing/ sales position. It was intensely mentally taxing. I learned a lot about myself in the process though. I found out that there was a limit to what I was willing to do for a company. I also learned that I have a leader mentality. I teach, coach, and share everything with those that want to learn. I also realized that my ego was very small and being humble is a huge part of growing as an individual.</p>

    <h3><a href="#">DMBflexo</a></h3>
    <h4>From: August 2016 To: July 2019</h4>
    <section>
      <p>This is the first company where the CEO came to me and told me that he wants me to take over the workflow that he put in place and make it better. He wanted to know about bottle necks in the development process. Being someone new to the flexographic printing world, I was intrigued. In 2019, he sold the company to a print shop in AL.</p>
